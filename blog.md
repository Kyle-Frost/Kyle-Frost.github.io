# The role of a Gameplay Programmer within the Games Industry.

A Gameplay Programmer is the person responsible for creating and writing the code for the intercatictions within a video game. The skills of a gameplay programmer will greatly affect the experience people have when they play that game. No game is the same, and so the job description, or role, of a gameplay programmer can vary largely depending on the company and project they work on. This means that versaility and and a means to adapt can be a gameplay programmers most valuable skill in this role.

## The Job Description.

Whilst the core concept of a gameplay programmers work is almost identical across the field, the actualy work they are tasked to do will vary. The size and scale of the company they work for will have a large impact on the work they do - typcially smaller company programmers will do more work across more of the game, whilst programmers working in larger studios will be tasked with just a small section of the game, as there are plenty others working on the other sections. Moreover, the experience level of programmers will impact the work they do. Lower-level, junior programmers for example, are more likely to be eased into work, given smaller amounts to do that regaulr gameplay programmers. Whereas on the other side of that spectrum, senior programmers could be given large amounts of work to complete due to their experience, but could also be tasked more with supervising a team of programmers instead. 

<a href="https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/Ubisoft2/743999713603389-gameplay-programmer">A job description for Ubisoft</a> states that "As a Gameplay Programmer, your job is to understand and challenge the design intentions of the game to turn them into gameplay features that will maximize the playability, believability and comfort for the players. Create solutions collaboratively to facilitate the integration and adaptation of gameplay elements such as design, sound and animation - into the game." The lack of specifics in this job post, from a well-known studio like Ubisoft, goes to show that the role isn't a cut and dry position. Workloads will always be different, and so a good problem-solving programmer will tend to thrive in this position.
