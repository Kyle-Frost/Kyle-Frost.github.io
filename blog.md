# The role of a Gameplay Programmer within the Games Industry.

A Gameplay Programmer is the person responsible for creating and writing the code for the interactions within a video game. The skills of a gameplay programmer will greatly affect the experience people have when they play that game. No game is the same, and so the job description, or role, of a gameplay programmer can vary largely depending on the company and project they work on. This means that versatility and a means to adapt can be a gameplay programmers most valuable skill in this role.

## The Job Description.

Whilst the core concept of a gameplay programmers work is almost identical across the field, the actually work they are tasked to do will vary. The size and scale of the company they work for will have a large impact on the work they do - typically smaller company programmers will do more work across more of the game, whilst programmers working in larger studios will be tasked with just a small section of the game, as there are plenty others working on the other sections. Moreover, the experience level of programmers will impact the work they do. Lower-level, junior programmers for example, are more likely to be eased into work, given smaller amounts to do that regular gameplay programmers. Whereas on the other side of that spectrum, senior programmers could be given large amounts of work to complete due to their experience but could also be tasked more with supervising a team of programmers instead. 

<a href="https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/Ubisoft2/743999713603389-gameplay-programmer">A job description for Ubisoft</a> states that "As a Gameplay Programmer, your job is to understand and challenge the design intentions of the game to turn them into gameplay features that will maximize the playability, believability and comfort for the players. Create solutions collaboratively to facilitate the integration and adaptation of gameplay elements such as design, sound and animation - into the game." The lack of specifics in this job post, from a well-known studio like Ubisoft, goes to show that the role is not a cut and dry position. Workloads will always be different, and so a good problem-solving programmer will tend to thrive in this position. 

## The Skills Required

The skills employers require from their gameplay programmers will vary dependant on the employer - for example, a company that predominantly uses the Unity game engine may require applicants to have Unity and C# experience, whereas a studio using Unreal Engine would perhaps require Unreal and C++ experience. The specifics of skills will almost always be displayed on the job description for the gameplay programmer role, and this will allow the applicant to have a better understanding on the sort of system and work they will be dealing with. The most important skill required is usually to have a strong knowledge of coding fundamentals, regardless of language specifics as many studios will have you learn as you go but having good knowledge of multiple coding languages is likely to be a sought-after skill. 

Personal skills, however, are often unanimous across most game studios. Good problem-solving skills, and the ability to easily adapt are essential skills for a gameplay programmer to have. As discussed, not all programming work will be the same, and so studios will find value in programmers that can think on their feet and adapt to their workload. There is no defined way to program, and so being able to problem solve and come up with an effective solution to a task is a strong skill to possess in this job role. Moreover, strong people and communication skills are well-valued in the programming industry. Even in small, Indie companies, but especially in large studios, gameplayer programmers will be part of a larger team that is required to communicate with each other for their project. Therefore, having good people skills will be paramount for the smooth running of a games project. For example, <a href="https://www.screenskills.com/careers/job-profiles/games/programming/gameplay-programmer/#:~:text=Gameplay%20programmers%20write%20the%20code,a%20game%20fun%20to%20play.&text=They%20write%20the%20rules%20that,optimise%20the%20game%20for%20playing">in this article from ScreenSkills</a>, "At the start of a game’s development, the gameplay programmer works with the writer and lead designer to figure out what needs to happen in the gameplay. They then work with the other programmers and artists. They also work with the QA technicians to improve the game." Programmers are constantly taking in and sharing data, so being able to do that efficiently will be a valuable skill, regardless of the scale of work. 

## Salaries and Benefits

A <a href="https://uk.talent.com/salary?job=game+programmer#:~:text=The%20average%20game%20programmer%20salary%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom%20is,to%20%C2%A370%2C000%20per%20year.">survey</a> conducted by <a href="uk.Talent.com">Talent</a> comprised 650 Game Programmer salaries to produce an average for the UK. They found that the average salary for a Game Programmer is £50,000 a year, with entry-level positions making £32,500 per year, and more experienced positions netting £70,000 per year. These figures suggest, when compare to the national average of £30,800 (<a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/bulletins/householddisposableincomeandinequality/financialyearending2020provisional#:~:text=More%20information%20about%20this%20process,30%2C100)%20shown%20in%20Figure%201.">ONS Government Average</a>) that the gameplay programming role is a well-paid job title. 
However, a <a href="https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/Salaries/gameplay-programmer-salary-SRCH_KO0,19.htm">survey</a> from GlassDoor comprising of 42 salaries suggests the average wage of a Gameplay Programmer is £31,000, and a <a href="https://www.payscale.com/research/UK/Job=Video_Game_Programmer/Salary">survey</a> from Payscale comprising of 71 salary profiles suggests the average wage is £27,196. These surveys suggest that the wage of a gameplay programmer heavily varies dependant on the location and company you work for. 

Gameplay Programmer positions don't typically come with additional benefits that you wouldn't otherwise see elsewhere, such as a company pension and bonuses (though game studio employees do often see bonuses for completed projects, especially when they do well). However, some games studios, such as Gearbox Software (famous for the Borderlands games), offer their programmers and employees a <a href="https://www.gearboxsoftware.com/gearbox-benefits/">profit sharing scheme</a>. A report from <a href="https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2020/04/02/report-gearbox-software-bonuses-low/">PlaystationLifestyle.net</a> suggests that the scheme is a 60/40 split. With 60% of profits going back into the studio, and 40% of the profits getting distributed to the employees as bonuses. 

## Other Careers

Gameplay programming is a popular entry-level job/role for junior developers due to the passion many have for video games and their creation. Whilst many programmers continue their careers in this role, a job as a Gameplay Programmer can lead you into various careers both inside and outside the games industry. Developing a strong knowledge of coding languages and programming as a whole will give you the skillset to move into different areas of the Games Industry, such as Game Engine or Engine Tools programming. But these skills can also take lead you to other IT careers outside of games, such as software development, or cyber security. Having a strong coding base and experience in a coding environment are acquirable skills for roles in other IT sectors, and whilst you may have to learn new methods and software, a Gameplay Programming role is a good entryway into those other careers.

## Advice

Despite having no industry experience, my research gives me ground to present advice on starting a career as a Gameplay Programmer. Above all, you must have a passion for games, and the way they are created. A passion for video games gives you the drive to learn and create that will allow you to succeed in this career. The nature of the work is likely to be tedious to those who don't find the work interesting, and a genuine enjoyment for video games and programming will separate the strong gameplay programmers from the average. Moreover, a want to learn will be important as there is no set knowledge for games programming. Becoming better at the role means learning to adapt and acquiring new skills and techniques to improve the quality of the work you produce.

Also, I feel that it is important that you understand the company and type of work you're applying for. As discussed, there is a vast difference in the type of work a gameplay programmer will be doing depending on the studio they work for. So, paying close attention to job descriptions and doing research on the studios will make getting started a smoother experience.
