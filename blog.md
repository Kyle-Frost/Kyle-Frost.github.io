# The role of a Gameplay Programmer within the Games Industry.

A Gameplay Programmer is the person responsible for creating and writing the code for the intercatictions within a video game. The skills of a gameplay programmer will greatly affect the experience people have when they play that game. No game is the same, and so the job description, or role, of a gameplay programmer can vary largely depending on the company and project they work on. This means that versaility and and a means to adapt can be a gameplay programmers most valuable skill in this role.

## The Job Description.

Whilst the core concept of a gameplay programmers work is almost identical across the field, the actualy work they are tasked to do will vary. The size and scale of the company they work for will have a large impact on the work they do - typcially smaller company programmers will do more work across more of the game, whilst programmers working in larger studios will be tasked with just a small section of the game, as there are plenty others working on the other sections. Moreover, the experience level of programmers will impact the work they do. Lower-level, junior programmers for example, are more likely to be eased into work, given smaller amounts to do that regaulr gameplay programmers. Whereas on the other side of that spectrum, senior programmers could be given large amounts of work to complete due to their experience, but could also be tasked more with supervising a team of programmers instead. 

<a href="https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/Ubisoft2/743999713603389-gameplay-programmer">A job description for Ubisoft</a> states that "As a Gameplay Programmer, your job is to understand and challenge the design intentions of the game to turn them into gameplay features that will maximize the playability, believability and comfort for the players. Create solutions collaboratively to facilitate the integration and adaptation of gameplay elements such as design, sound and animation - into the game." The lack of specifics in this job post, from a well-known studio like Ubisoft, goes to show that the role isn't a cut and dry position. Workloads will always be different, and so a good problem-solving programmer will tend to thrive in this position. 

## The Skills Required

The skills employers require from their gameplay programmers will vary dependant on the employer - for example, a company that predominantly uses the Unity game engine may require applicants to have Unity and C# experience, whereas a studio using Unreal Engine would perhaps require Unreal and C++ experience. The specifics of skills will almost always be displayed on the job description for the gameplay programmer role, and this will allow the applicant to have a better understanding on the sort of system and work they will be dealing with. The most important skill required is usually to have a strong knowledge of coding fudamentals, regardless of language specifics as many studios will have you learn as you go, but having good knowdelge of multiple coding languages is likely to be a sought-after skill. 

Personal skills however, are often unanimous across most game studios. Good problem solving skills, and the ability to easily adapt are essential skills for a gameplay programmer to have. As discussed, not all programming work will be the same, and so studios will find value in programmers that can think on their feet, and adapt to their workload. There is no defined way to program, and so being able to problem solve and come up with an effective solution to a task is a strong skill to possess in this job role. Moreover, strong people and communication skills are well-valued in the progamming industry. Even in small, indi companies, but especially in large studios, gameplayer programmers will be part of a larger team that is required to communicate with each other for their project. Therefore, having good people skills will be paramount for the smooth running of a games project. For example, <a href="https://www.screenskills.com/careers/job-profiles/games/programming/gameplay-programmer/#:~:text=Gameplay%20programmers%20write%20the%20code,a%20game%20fun%20to%20play.&text=They%20write%20the%20rules%20that,optimise%20the%20game%20for%20playing">in this article from ScreenSkills</a>, "At the start of a gameâ€™s development, the gameplay programmer works with the writer and lead designer to figure out what needs to happen in the gameplay. They then work with the other programmers and artists. They also work with the QA technicians to improve the game." Programmers are constantly taking in and sharing data, so being able to do that efficiently will be a valuable skill, regalrdless of the scale of work.
